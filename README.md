# Final_Project
Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Setup & Summary:
Once you run the script a pop up window will appear where you will be able to play the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
You are able to play numerours rounds in the same window against a computer, with the results being instantaneous.

Features:
- This script uses the tkinter package which allowed for the pop up windown and more game-like feel
    - Within this package there was the ability to customize the window to my liking using HTML for the buttons, font, color, etc.
- There is an imported random module that enables the computer's choices
- I used global variables to define the buttons and labels on display
- I used a function for every option the player can choose (i.e. rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock)
- I also created the main function that allowed the game to run by tying in all the "baby" or smaller functions
